<p>Artificial Intelligence has moved from a theoretical advantage to a critical infrastructure component. As
    organizations increasingly rely on black-box models for decision-making, the ability to audit, explain, and trace
    these decisions—<strong>AI Forensics</strong>—has become paramount.</p>

<h2>1. The Black Box Problem</h2>
<p>Modern neural networks, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), operate with billions of parameters. When a model
    hallucinates or provides a biased output, tracing the root cause is akin to finding a needle in a digital haystack.
    Traditional debugging tools are insufficient for this non-deterministic behavior.</p>
<p>In high-stakes industries like Finance and Healthcare, "we don't know why it did that" is not an acceptable answer.
    This is where Aegisight's forensic layer comes in.</p>

<h2>2. Key Forensic Methodologies</h2>
<h3>2.1. Feature Contribution Analysis</h3>
<p>By mapping output tokens back to specific neuron activations, we can determine which features (or input segments)
    contributed most heavily to a decision. This allows us to flag potential over-reliance on irrelevant data.</p>

<h3>2.2. Counterfactual Testing</h3>
<p>What if the input had been slightly different? Counterfactual testing involves systematically perturbing inputs to
    see how the model's output boundaries shift. This stress-testing reveals fragility in the model's logic.</p>

<h2>3. Regulatory Compliance & The EU AI Act</h2>
<p>New regulations mandate explainability. The EU AI Act classifies certain AI systems as "high-risk," requiring
    detailed logging and transparency. Implementing a robust forensic layer is no longer just good engineering—it's the
    law.</p>

<h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The future of AI adoption rests on trust. By implementing rigorous forensic standards today, organizations can
    inoculate themselves against the regulatory and reputational risks of tomorrow.</p>

Aegisight AI: MVP Master Execution PlanVersion: 1.2 (Dual-Path Strategy)Focus: Predictive Incident Prevention SystemPersona: Sarah, IT Ops DirectorCore Promise: "We predict the incidents your current tools miss."1. Executive Summary: The Dual-Path MVPWe are splitting the MVP into two distinct modes to accelerate trust and adoption.ModeNameGoalUser ActionOption 1The Risk AuditImmediate Proof. Prove the "Brain" works using historical data without requiring IT permissions.User uploads a CSV file of past incidents/logs. System generates a "Retro-Prediction Report."Option 2The MonitorReal-Time Protection. The scalable product that runs 24/7.User connects ServiceNow API. System provides real-time "Risk Alerts."The "Aha!" MomentAudit Mode: "Wow, you found the exact pattern that caused our outage last month."Monitor Mode: "The system just alerted us to a high CPU spike 2 hours before we usually see tickets."2. Strategic AlignmentComponentStrategic Role (Business)Learning Path Role (Technical)The BrainCore Value. Forecasting failures.BigQuery ML: Mastering ARIMA_PLUS.The Ingest (CSV)Low-Friction Sales. "Try before you integrate."File Handling: Parsing uploads & Bulk Inserts to DB.The Ingest (API)Stickiness. "Set it and forget it."ServiceNow Integration: OAuth & REST API.3. Go-To-Market StrategyStep 1: The "Coffee Shop" Pitch (Option 1)The Hook: "You don't need to install anything. Just export your incident log from last month to CSV."The Process: You meet the partner/client, upload their CSV into your local Aegisight instance.The Result: A generated report showing: "Here are 3 times your system failed. Aegisight predicted all 3 of them 4 hours in advance."Step 2: The "Pilot" Upgrade (Option 2)The Upsell: "Now that you trust the brain, let's turn it on live. We'll connect to your ServiceNow Sandbox today."4. Technical Architecture & Data Flowgraph LR

5. Execution: The Antigravity Agent InstructionsUse these updated prompts to build the CSV Uploader first (easier/faster), then the ServiceNow Connector.Phase 1: The Simulator (Data Generation)Keep this for your own internal testing.Instruction:Create a standalone script scripts/simulate_data.js.Generate cpu_load (0-100) and ticket_velocity (int) data.Failure Pattern: 10% of the time, CPU > 90% AND Tickets > 10.Save this as sample_data.csv (so we can test the CSV uploader immediately) AND insert into DB.Phase 2: The "Risk Audit" (CSV Importer)New Feature: Immediate Proof of ValueInstruction:Create a new API route POST /api/upload-csv and a simple frontend "Upload" button.Frontend: Allow user to select a CSV file.Backend: Use a stream parser (like fast-csv) to read the file.Validation: Ensure columns timestamp, cpu_load, ticket_velocity exist.Action: Bulk insert valid rows into the BigQuery dataset (or TimescaleDB buffer first).Trigger: Automatically run the Training Query (Phase 3) after upload completes.Phase 3: The Brain (BigQuery ML)Instruction:Create src/models/risk_engine.sql.CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL using ARIMA_PLUS.Train on the data currently in the table (whether from CSV or API).Create a query to DETECT_ANOMALIES with anomaly_probability > 0.75.Phase 4: The "Monitor" (ServiceNow Connector)The Scalable FeatureInstruction:Create a service src/services/servicenow.js.Use axios with Basic Auth (credentials in .env).Fetch incidents from /api/now/table/incident (Last 30 days).Normalization: Map ServiceNow JSON fields to match the CSV schema (e.g., opened_at -> timestamp).Insert into the same DB table used by the CSV importer.Phase 5: The Dashboard (Risk Grader)Instruction:Create route GET /dashboard.Status Gauge: Show latest Risk Score (Red/Green).Data Source Toggle: Add a label showing "Source: [CSV Audit | Live API]".Graph: Plot the cpu_load vs ticket_velocity data.6. Pre-Flight Checklist[ ] Google Cloud Key: Ensure key.json is linked in .env.[ ] BigQuery Dataset: Create aegisight_mvp.[ ] CSV Sample: Run your simulator script to generate a test_upload.csv file so you can test Option 1 immediately.

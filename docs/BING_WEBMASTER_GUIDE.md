# How to Get Listed on Bing (Bing Webmaster Tools)

Since your site is new or not yet indexed by Bing, you need to manually tell them it exists. This is the fastest way to fix the issue.

## Step 1: Sign Up
1.  Go to **[Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters)**.
2.  Sign in with a Microsoft, Google, or Facebook account.

## Step 2: Add Your Site
1.  Enter your URL: `https://aegisight.ai`
2.  Click **Add**.

## Step 3: Verify Ownership
Bing needs to know you own the site.
1.  Choose **"HTML Meta Tag"** as the verification method.
2.  Copy the code they give you (it looks like `<meta name="msvalidate.01" content="..." />`).
3.  **Send this code to me**, and I will add it to your website's header.
    *   *Alternatively, if you have Google Search Console set up, you can import your site from there instantly.*

## Step 4: Submit Sitemap
Once verified:
1.  Go to **Sitemaps** in the left menu.
2.  Click **Submit Sitemap**.
3.  Enter: `https://aegisight.ai/sitemap.xml`
4.  Click **Submit**.

## Step 5: Wait
Bing will now crawl your site. It usually takes **24-48 hours** to start appearing in search results.

# Aegisight: Product Strategy & Roadmap
**The "One Platform" Architecture**

We do not sell seven different tools; we sell one **Core Prediction Engine** that powers three distinct pillars of protection.

## The Three Pillars of Protection
1.  **Digital Asset Protection**: IT Risk (ServiceNow), Financial Fraud (ERP).
2.  **Physical Asset Protection**: Supply Chain Logistics (SAP), Project Timelines.
3.  **Human Asset Protection**: Industrial Bio-Safety (Wearables), Pension Solvency.

## Execution Roadmap: The "Crawl, Walk, Run" Approach (Aggressive)

### GOAL A: Foundation & Market Entry (Crawl + Walk Phase)
**Objective**: Build the Core Engine AND Launch Products 1 & 2 immediately.
**Focus**: Prove ROI by validating the engine on both IT and Supply Chain data concurrently.

*   **Key Metrics (Success Signals)**:
    1.  **Viability**: Model Prediction Accuracy **>85%**.
    2.  **Fidelity**: False Positive Rate **<15%** (Alert Fidelity).
    3.  **Efficiency**: Training TCO **<$500** annualized.
*   **Technical Implementation**:
    *   **Engine**: `risk_engine_hybrid.sql` (ARIMA + XGBoost).
    *   **Products**: IT Risk Plug-in (ServiceNow) & Supply Chain Plug-in (`simulate_supply_chain.js`).
    *   **Dual-Deployment**: "Downloadable Brain" (Docker/DuckDB) for on-prem compliance.
    *   **Self-Service**: "Risk Grader" CSV Upload for lead-gen.

### GOAL B: Strategic Expansion (Run Phase)
**Objective**: Expansion into Future Verticals (Human & Financial).
**Focus**: Leverage the proven platform to enter high-regulation markets requiring high trust (GDPR/HIPAA).
*   **Target Sectors**: Industrial Bio-Safety, Pension Solvency.
*   **Key Metric**: Multi-pillar adoption (customers using >2 modules).
*   **Technical Implementation**:
    *   **Federated Learning**: Cross-customer model training.
    *   **Agentic Action**: "Self-Driving" remediation integration.

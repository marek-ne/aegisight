# How to Force Google to Update Your Icon

Since you already have Google Search Console set up, you just need to tell Google to "look again" at your homepage.

## Step 1: Select Your Property
1.  Open **[Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)**.
2.  In the top-left dropdown, select **`https://aegisight.ai/`** (or the Domain property `aegisight.ai`).

## Step 2: Inspect Your Homepage
1.  In the top search bar ("Inspect any URL in..."), type:
    `https://aegisight.ai`
2.  Press **Enter**.
3.  Wait for the data to load.

## Step 3: Request Indexing
1.  You will see a page showing the status of the URL.
2.  Click the **"REQUEST INDEXING"** button (usually grey/white).
3.  This puts your site in a priority queue to be re-crawled.

## Step 4: Submit Sitemap (If you haven't recently)
1.  Click **Sitemaps** in the left menu.
2.  Under "Add a new sitemap", enter: `sitemap.xml`
3.  Click **Submit**.

**That's it!**
Google will now re-visit your site, see the new 192x192 icon code, and update the search results. This typically takes **24-48 hours** after you click "Request Indexing".
